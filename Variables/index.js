// //Variables are containers for storing data (values).
// //rules for declaring variable name
// Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
// Names must begin with a letter
// Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
// Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
// Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

let x = 10; //we can declare variable name with both let and var
var y = 20;
console.log(x);
console.log(y);

var name = "Nabin";
console.log(name);
var name = "Dhami"; //Variables name can be changed
console.log(name);

// If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
var a = "5" + 2 + 3;
console.log(a);

// let fname = "Nabin";
// console.log(fname);
// let fname = "Dhami"; //Error
// console.log(fname);
